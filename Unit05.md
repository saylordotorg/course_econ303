-   **Unit 5: Compensating Wage Differentials**  

    *In the previous units, you learned how a worker decides whether he
    or she should work or not, and how long he or she should work for.
     These units worked from a competitive labor market model based on
    the assumption that all jobs and workers are homogenous in nature.
     In this scenario, the compensation was the sole factor that
    determined whether an individual would take a job or not.  In
    reality, however, we cannot ignore the heterogeneous nature of both
    the work force and the job market; we know that different workers
    focus on different aspects of a job when making the decision to work
    or not.  Therefore, we will now adopt a more realistic approach,
    considering the roles that both compensation and non-wage
    characteristics play in an individual’s decision to accept a given
    job offer.  The differences between types of labor and the skill
    sets that workers have result in corresponding differences in
    wages.  In this unit, you will study how differences in job
    characteristics have an impact on the determination of wages and
    employment.  (The determination of wages and employment due to
    differences in skills of workers will be presented in the next
    section.)*

    **Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  

    Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

    -   Analyze the reasons behind wage differentials due to non
        pecuniary characteristics of alternative types of employment.
    -     
    -   Analyze the hedonic pricing model with the end result of
        employer-employee matching and analyze the theoretical model to
        the case study presented in the end of this unit.
    -     
    -   Analyze how equilibrium is reached in the market for risky jobs.
    -     
    -   Mathematically use the concept of compensating wage
        differentials.
