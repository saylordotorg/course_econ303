-   **Unit 4: Labor Market Equilibrium**  

    *In order to complete the demand-supply framework of the labor
    market, we will now determine the model’s equilibrium levels.  This
    unit will focus on how the market clearing wage is generated in
    competitive and non-competitive market structures.  The equilibrium
    wage rate and the efficiency of competitive labor markets play
    important roles in determining appropriate public policies.  The
    most common policy methods that the government uses are taxes and
    subsidies; through their adoption, the government can shift the
    labor market to a new equilibrium.  This issue will be explored in
    the "Policy Implications" topic under this unit.*
