-   **Unit 11: Compensation and Productivity**  

     *Labor market contracts and the overall compensation packages that
    firms provide to their employees can affect a worker's productivity
    level.  Even if two workers have the same level of human capital,
    they may differ from one another in their respective work habits,
    level of motivation, and responsiveness to their environment, among
    other things.  Quite often, the firms cannot gauge the productivity
    of their employees when they are hired.  Given the above situation,
    firms must choose appropriate management strategies and offer the
    right compensation packages to their employees so as to provide a
    high level of work incentive and optimize worker productivity.  This
    unit examines how compensation packages affect worker productivity
    and firm profits.*
