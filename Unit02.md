-   **Unit 2: Labor Supply**  

    *The past century has seen a number of dramatic shifts in labor
    trends.  This section attempts to explain some of major stylized
    facts observed over the last century.  For example, labor force
    participation rates in the United States have experienced dramatic
    changes in the past century.  This holds true for both men and
    women, though in different capacities: while labor force
    participation rates have steadily declined for men, there has been a
    huge increase in participation rates for women.  It is worth
    emphasizing that female labor force participation has been
    particularly steep among married women.  These dramatic shifts have
    been accompanied by sizeable declines in the average hours worked
    per week.  Economists have also observed that the labor supply tends
    to vary across other dimensions, such as race and education level,
    phenomena observed in other industrialized countries as well.  This
    observation has motivated much of the recent research conducted in
    the area of labor economics. *  
       
     *In this section, you will first learn about the neo-classical
    model of labor-leisure choice.  This model seeks to explain the
    factors that determine an individual's decision to work for pay and
    the number of hours he/she is willing to work.  You will then learn
    about the derivation of the labor supply curve and the measure of
    elasticity before discussing the impact that different government
    policies have on an individual’s decision to work.*  
       
     *Please note that the material covered in subunit 2.1 pertains to
    the static theory of labor supply.  The last section in this unit,
    however, will present topics in labor supply studied over time.*

         Instructions: This is an optional lecture and not a requirement
        of the course.  The introduction to this unit pointed out that
        the labor supply of women has changed over the years.  In this
        guest lecture, the speaker talks about the dramatic shifts in
        the power dynamics between men and women across the world. 
        Illustrating her point with statistical evidence, she explains
        what "polarization of the economy" means and how, for example,
        the recession affects men and women in different capacities. 
        This talk should enable you to think about the economic impact
        that changes like these bring about.
