-   **Unit 7: Labor Mobility**  

    *Labor mobility takes place when workers are incentivized to find
    better jobs and/or firms are incentivized to find better workers. 
    Labor mobility is broadly categorized into two subcategories:
    "geographical mobility" (moving across physical space) and
    “occupational mobility” (moving between or across jobs).  At the
    personal level, increased labor mobility may imply better financial
    situations for most workers because, assuming that mobility is
    voluntary, workers will decide to move only if the present value of
    the benefits from moving exceed the costs of moving.  At the
    aggregate level, one of the most important benefits of labor
    mobility is its impact on growth and production.  The economic
    benefits of reallocating workers often leads to the discovery and
    exploitation of new resources, the use of new technologies, and the
    growth of new industries.  However, looking beyond economics, labor
    mobility is also closely tied to issues of state sovereignty,
    political concerns, and governmental control, especially with
    regards to immigration.*  
     *             
     In this unit, you will study migration and its determinants,
    consequences (both for the migrant and the place of emigration), and
    constituents (in terms of the characteristic differences between
    migrants).*

    **Unit 7 Time Advisory**
