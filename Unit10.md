-   **Unit 10: Unions**  

    *We will now introduce labor unions and collective bargaining models
    to our study of the workings of the labor market.  Although labor
    unions attempt to maximize the well-being of their members and
    improve their economic status, they are often condemned because of
    the costs they impose on other members of society.  In order to
    protect the interests of both employers and employees, legislation
    has played a huge role in determining the power of unions. *  
       
     *Since the political and institutional environment plays an
    important role in defining employer-union relationship, differences
    in the proportions of unionized workers between countries can be
    explained by the differences in the political effectiveness of
    various union movements.  In the United States, private sector
    unions have nearly vanished, but public sector workers have
    continued to maintain their unionism over the years.*
