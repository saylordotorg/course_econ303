-   **Unit 6: Human Capital Investments**  

    *The theory of compensating wage differentials (studied in the
    previous unit) explains differences in wages as differences in job
    characteristics.  The theory of human capital (presented in this
    unit) explains differences in wages as differences in the skills and
    abilities of workers.  Note that "skills and abilities" are acquired
    by the worker through education, job training, and so
    forth—“investments” he or she makes with the hope that the returns
    will be higher in the future.  Unlike the models studied so far, the
    models presented in this section do not occur "at a given point in
    time," but are seen from a lifetime perspective.*

    -   Mathematically and analytically estimate the economics of
        education.
    -
