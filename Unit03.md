-   **Unit 3: The Demand for Labor**  

    *This unit focuses on the "demand side" of the labor market.  The
    demand for labor is quite similar to that of a firm's demand for
    other inputs in the production process.  However, the demand for
    labor can also be influenced by important social and political
    considerations, several of which will be discussed here.  After
    studying the mechanics of labor demand, you will take a look at how
    economic policies can regulate various aspects of a firm's labor
    demand.*

    **Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  

    Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

    -   Calculate and identify the shape of the “Marginal Revenue
        Product” (MRP) of labor.
    -     
    -   Compare “Marginal Revenue Products” and “Marginal Factor Costs”
        (MFC) of labor to determine how it affects labor usage by a
        profit maximizing firm.
    -     
    -   Analyze labor demand and wages in perfectly competitive markets
        and in monopsony markets.
    -     
    -   Analyze the effects of minimum wages under monopsony market
        conditions and the effect of payroll taxes on equilibrium wage
        and employment.
    -     
    -   Calculate labor demand elasticities.
