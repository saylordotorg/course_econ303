-   **Unit 9: Unemployment**  

    *The equilibrium level of unemployment in a country can never be
    zero because, at any given time, there are people who are entering
    the labor force, or are between jobs, and are counted as
    unemployed.  Most people perceive the unemployed as those who have
    been laid off from their jobs.  Although it is true that this group
    of people comprises the majority of the unemployed population when
    the economy is experiencing a cyclical slowdown or recession, during
    normal years, the unemployed population encompasses a wider group
    that also includes those who are new entrants or reentrants to the
    labor force. *  
     *             
     In this unit, we will study different types of unemployment and
    then move on to the different components of job-hunting, followed by
    the impact of unemployment insurance on the length of unemployment. 
    We will conclude the unit by learning about efficiency wages and its
    relation to unemployment.*
