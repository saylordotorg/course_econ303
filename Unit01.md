-   **Unit 1: Introduction**  

    *The three key players in the labor market are the worker, the firm,
    and the government.  In the first part of this unit, you will learn
    that the interactions between these players can be studied in one of
    two ways:  by observing and predicting their behavior in various
    situations in the labor market arena (the positive economics way) or
    by placing a value judgment on their interactions and determining
    whether the situation is desirable or harmful (the normative
    economics way).  This unit will also teach you how the labor force
    is measured and will provide you with a simple supply-demand
    framework designed to show you how the labor market works.*

        respectively.  (For instance, from the first example, you can
        frame the following question: "Ceteris Paribus, do high wages
        offered by a competitor cause an influx of workers from the low
        wage employer to the high wage employer?"  Ask yourself whether
        it belongs to the normative economics or the positive economics
        category.)
