-   **Unit 8: Discrimination in the Labor Market**  

    *Most of the world has seen a dramatic diversification of the labor
    market, especially in the last fifty years.  The demographic changes
    that have occurred in the past few decades are particularly apparent
    in labor data collected during that period.  The proportion of women
    in the labor force has increased dramatically in the past and their
    rate of growth continues to be higher than that of men.  In
    addition, the participation of racial/ethnic groups in the American
    labor force has also increased substantially as a result of
    immigration.  However, a certain level of discrepancy in earnings
    and employment opportunities on the basis of gender and race
    persists.  Economists study this discrimination by examining the
    relationship between the socio-economic backgrounds of workers and
    their productivity and skills.  In order to “measure”
    discrimination, economists have developed various frameworks for
    decomposing racial and gender wage differentials.  Economists also
    study long-run trends in wage differentials based on gender and race
    in order to gain valuable insight into governmental policies
    designed to mitigate discrimination.*
